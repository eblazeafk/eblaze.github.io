# About Me
## I am interested in rock climbing, pc building, videogames, and music
### I love rock climbing, it is my version of working out. I go to the gym to do lifting and stuff sometimes as well but rock climbing is a fun alternitive. It hits core, legs, arms and im getting veins from it as well. When i am rock climbing i listen to my music, i like more rap and r&b focused music, sometimes instrumental.
